/**
 *
 * Alternatively, one can solve this problem directly by tree dp.
 * Let dp[i] be the height of the tree when the tree root is i.
 * We compute dp[0] ... dp[n - 1] by tree dp in a dfs manner.
 *
 * Arbitrarily pick a node, say node 0, as the root, and do a dfs.
 * When reach a node u, and let T be the subtree by removing all u's descendant (see the right figure below).
 * We maintain a variable acc that keeps track of the length of the longest path in T with one endpoint being u.
 * Then dp[u] = max(height[u], acc)
 * Note, acc is 0 for the root of the tree.
 *
 *                 |                 |
 *                 .                 .
 *                /|\               /|\
 *               * u *             * u *
 *                /|\
 *               / | \
 *              *  v  *
 *
 *  . denotes a single node, and * denotes a subtree (possibly empty).
 *
 *  Now it remains to calculate the new acc for any of u's child, v.
 *  It is easy to see that the new acc is the max of the following
 *
 *  1) acc + 1 --- extend the previous path by the edge uv;
 *  2) max(height[v'] + 2), where v != v' --- see below for an example.
 *
 *                 u
 *                /|
 *               / |
 *              v' v
 *              |
 *              .
 *              .
 *              .
 *              |
 *              .
 *
 * In fact, the second case can be computed in O(1) time instead of spending a time proportional to the degree of u.
 * Otherwise, the runtime can be quadratic when the degree of some node is Omega(n).
 * The trick here is to maintain two heights of each node, the largest height (the conventional height), and the second largest height
 * (the height of the node after removing the branch w.r.t. the largest height).
 *
 * Therefore, after the dfs, all dp[i]'s are computed, and the problem can be answered trivially.
 * The total runtime is still O(n).
